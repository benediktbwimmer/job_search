      "description": "The vLLM and LLM-D Engineering team at Red Hat is looking for a customer obsessed developer to join our team as a Forward Deployed Engineer. In this role, you will not just build software; you will be the bridge between our cutting-edge inference platform (LLM-D, and vLLM) and our customers' most critical production environments. You will interface directly with the engineering teams at our customer to deploy, optimize, and scale distributed Large Language Model (LLM) inference systems. You will solve \"last mile\" infrastructure challenges that defy off-the-shelf solutions, ensuring that massive models run with low latency and high throughput on complex Kubernetes clusters. This is not a sales engineering role, you will be part of the core vLLM and LLM-D engineering team. What You Will Do Orchestrate Distributed Inference: Deploy and configure LLM-D and vLLM on Kubernetes clusters. You will set up and configure advanced deployment like disaggregated serving, KV-cache aware routing, KV Cache offloading etc to maximize hardware utilization. Optimize for Production: Go beyond standard deployments by running performance benchmarks, tuning vLLM parameters, and configuring intelligent inference routing policies to meet SLOs for latency and throughput. You care about Time Per Output Token (TPOT), GPU utilization, GPU networking optimizations, and Kubernetes scheduler efficiency. Code Side-by-Side: Work directly with customer engineers to write production-quality code (Python/Go/YAML) that integrates our inference engine into their existing Kubernetes ecosystem. Solve the \"Unsolvable\": Debug complex interaction effects between specific model architectures (e.g., MoE, large context windows), hardware accelerators (NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs, TPUs), and Kubernetes networking (Envoy/ISTIO). Feedback Loop: Act as the \"Customer Zero\" for our core engineering teams. You will channel field learnings back to product development, influencing the roadmap for LLM-D and vLLM features. Travel only as needed to customers to present, demo, or help execute proof-of-concepts. What You Will Bring 8+ Years of Engineering Experience: You have a decade-long track record in Backend Systems, SRE, or Infrastructure Engineering. Customer Fluency: You speak both \"Systems Engineering\" and \"Business Value\". Bias for Action: You prefer rapid prototyping and iteration over theoretical perfection. You are comfortable operating in ambiguity and taking ownership of the outcome. Deep Kubernetes Expertise: You are fluent in K8s primitives, from defining custom resources (CRDs, Operators, Controllers) to configuring modern ingress via the Gateway API. You have deep experience with stateful workloads and high-performance networking, including the ability to tune scheduler logic (affinity/tolerations) for GPU workloads and troubleshoot complex CNI failures. AI Inference Proficiency: You understand how a LLM forward pass works. You know what KV Caching is, why prefill/decode disaggregation matters, why context length impacts performance, and how continuous batching works in vLLM. Systems Programming: Proficiency in Python (for model interfaces) and Go (for Kubernetes controllers/scheduler logic). Infrastructure as Code: Experience with Helm, Terraform, or similar tools for reproducible deployments. Cloud &amp; GPU Hardware Fluency: You are comfortable spinning up clusters and deploying LLMs on bare-metal and hyperscaler Kubernetes clusters Following is considered a plus Experience contributing to open-source AI infrastructure projects (e.g., KServe, vLLM, Kubernetes). Knowledge of Envoy Proxy or Inference Gateway (IGW). Familiarity with model optimization techniques like Quantization (AWQ, GPTQ) and Speculative Decoding. #AI-HIRING #LI-MD2 The salary range for this position is $189,600.00 - $312,730.00.

      "description": "Headquarters: USA URL: https://superplane.com/ About SuperPlane SuperPlane is an AI-native DevOps control plane. Our mission is to build the platform teams use to ship and manage software in the AI era. Agents are helping us write an order of magnitude more code, while systems have become too complex for human-driven ops alone. We're rethinking DevOps from first principles for the AI era: a single control layer where engineers and agents safely collaborate. We move fast. We aim high. If that sounds like the kind of problem you want to work on, we’d love to talk. About the Role At SuperPlane, you’ll build the Cursor for DevOps.. This is an applied role. You’ll take modern AI capabilities such as LLMs, agents, retrieval, planning, and evaluation and turn them into reliable, observable, production systems that real engineers depend on. You’ll work at the boundary between models, infrastructure, and product, making careful tradeoffs between capability, latency, cost, and safety. What You’ll Do Design and implement AI-powered features end to end, including prompts, agents, tools, retrieval, evaluation, and feedback loops. Build agent systems that interact safely with infrastructure, codebases, and deployment pipelines. Integrate LLMs deeply into product workflows as core platform primitives. Own quality across correctness, reliability, latency, and cost of AI systems in production. Collaborate closely with Product, Frontend, and Backend engineers to ship cohesive user-facing features. Establish best practices for prompt design, evaluation, observability, and iteration. Requirements You shipped production systems where LLMs, tool calling, or RAG workflows were part of the core functionality. You’ve built and owned highly reliable backend systems with strong engineering judgment and technical depth.&nbsp; You are willing to master Go and Typescript. You’ve developed systematic LLM evaluation pipelines using observability tools (LangSmith/Braintrust) to track performance and regressions. You worked closely with product and frontend partners to deliver user-facing features. You communicate clearly in writing and in technical discussions. Why You’ll Love Working at SuperPlane Work on an open source platform shaping the future of DevOps worldwide. Build AI systems that operate real infrastructure, not toy demos. Competitive compensation &amp; meaningful equity in a high-growth startup.
